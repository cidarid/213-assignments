/*
TODO: Change bubble_sort_static.c to use dynamic arrays. Specifically, turn val
into a dynamic array and allow the program to sort arbitrary lists of integers
provided on the command line (e.g. more than 4). Recall that to allocate
dynamic arrays, you use the procedure malloc. For example, to allocate an array
of ten shorts, you say: short *s = malloc (10 * sizeof(*s));
